# In this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring. 
# You have to print the number of times that the substring occurs in the given string. 
# String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.

# Sample Input
# ABCDCDC
# CDC

# Sample Output
# 2

# Solution: 

def count_substring(string, sub_string):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i:len(string)].startswith(sub_string):
            total += 1
    return total
